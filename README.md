Welcome to Reddist

Reddist is an android application that periodically receives updates from the Reddit website and displays them in the most friendly way to the user.

Reddit is a social network website that allows its users to submit content such as direct links or posts and vote on other users' submissions. The website would then create different lists (called sublists) to rank and order the posts according to different criteria such as  score, time of submission and so forth. There are also different Subreddits where users post content related to specific categories such as music, art, fitness etc.

The purpose of Reddist is to keep its users up to date about the latest happenings on the Reddit website. Users can browse different Subreddits and Sublists on their phone, check out the posts on the browser build into the application or their own favorite browser, share their favorite posts with their friends through text message, email, social network apps or any other means of communication on the phone and receive notifications when new content becomes available all in a simple user friendly manner that minimizes their distraction.

Reddists however, is not intended to implement some advanced features available on the Reddit website like voting up/down, replying to posts or leaving comments or in any way manipulate the content available on Reddit.
